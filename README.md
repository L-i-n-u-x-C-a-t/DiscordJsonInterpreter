# DiscordJsonInterpreter
This program allows you to read your user.json file you got from discord in a more efficient way than just opening it.\
There is 2 programs here, a command line one and a graphical one.

## Building
### Command line
Just do `g++ main.cpp` and it's done.\
The output will be named a.out/a.exe depending on your OS.

### Graphical
For that, you need Qt 5.12+. I have no idea how to build this as i did it with Qt Creator but `qmake && make` may work idk\
output will be named dji-qt/dji-qt.exe depending on your OS.
